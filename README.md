terminal-bitcoin-graph
=================

###REQUIREMENTS
* Gnuplot
* Python 3

###TODO
* experiment with other libaries/programsm that allow of more freedom in plotting (Such as colours and not just using "*" -- As far as I know, this is a limitation of gnuplot when ploting to dumb terminal)
* Support other api's (Should currently support BTC-E's api's)
* make the time on the X axis show the hour as well (I'm not sure why it isn't right now, maybe it only shows up when it's ploting more than 1 hour?)
